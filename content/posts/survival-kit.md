Living in a hostel is an extreme sport. You have limited space, one plug point, and zero privacy.
After 2 years of engineering, I've curated the ultimate list of 10 things that make hostel life bearable.

### 1. The "Power Hub" (Extension Board)
You have a phone, laptop, smartwatch, and power bank. Your room has *one* socket. Do the math.
* **Get this:** A board with USB slots so you don't need adapters.
* **Best Pick:** [Check Price on Amazon](https://amzn.to/45eNiVA)

### 2. Wireless Mouse (Logitech B170)
Coding on a trackpad is torture. If you are serious about LeetCode or Dev, you need a mouse.
* **Why this one:** It's cheap, practically indestructible, and the battery lasts 12 months.
* **Best Pick:** [Check Price on Amazon](https://amzn.to/4pMDF8b)

### 3. Aluminium Laptop Stand
Hunching over your laptop for 6 hours destroys your neck. This lifts the screen to eye level and keeps your laptop cool during compile times.
* **Best Pick:** [Check Price on Amazon](https://amzn.to/4a3ROIj)

### 4. Electric Kettle (The Midnight Savior)
Mess closed? Hungry at 2 AM? This boils water for Maggi, Coffee, or Oatmeal in 3 minutes.
* **Best Pick:** [Check Price on Amazon](https://amzn.to/3Z3e4gl)

### 5. 10,000mAh Power Bank
Hostel power cuts are unpredictable. Don't let your phone die in the middle of a call (or a game).
* **Best Pick:** [Check Price on Amazon](https://amzn.to/4sIkeQf)

### 6. Rechargeable Desk Lamp
Roommates want to sleep, but you have a bug to fix. This focused light saves you from fights.
* **Best Pick:** [Check Price on Amazon](https://amzn.to/3NmzfY4)

### 7. 4-Port USB Hub (High Speed)
Modern laptops have only 2 ports. You have a mouse, pen drive, phone, and dev boards. This lets you plug them all in at once.
* **Best Pick:** [Check Price on Amazon](https://amzn.to/45juUem)

### 8. Dual Drive Pen Drive (Type-C)
Hostel WiFi can be fast, but sometimes it blocks the sites you need. Quickly transfer movies or huge datasets from a friend.
* **Best Pick:** [Check Price on Amazon](https://amzn.to/49qPpbt)

### 9. Adhesive Wall Hooks
No drilling allowed? These stick to the wall for your towel, bag, and ID card. Essential for organization.
* **Best Pick:** [Check Price on Amazon](https://amzn.to/4k3GqAN)

### 10. Number Lock (Combination Padlock)
Keys get lost. A 4-digit code doesn't. Secure your cupboard or laptop bag from "borrowers."
* **Best Pick:** [Check Price on Amazon](https://amzn.to/4b34fpR)
