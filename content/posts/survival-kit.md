I learned this the hard way: Hostel rooms are bare bones. You need to upgrade them yourself.

Here are 4 cheap gadgets that saved my sanity (and my deposit money).

### 1. The "Warden-Safe" Wall Hooks
You aren't allowed to drill nails. But you have wet towels, ID cards, and bags.
* **The Hack:** Adhesive Wall Hooks. They stick to anything and peel off without leaving a mark.
* **Why I love them:** My room is finally organized.
* **Buy Here:** [Self Adhesive Heavy Duty Hooks] (PASTE_AMAZON_LINK_HERE)

### 2. The 10,000mAh Lifesaver (Power Bank)
Power cuts happen exactly when your phone is at 4%.
* **Real Talk:** Don't buy the cheap knock-offs. Get a standard 10k mAh one. It charges my phone 2 full times.
* **My Pick:** [Mi Power Bank 3i / Ambrane 10k] (PASTE_AMAZON_LINK_HERE)

### 3. The "Anti-Malaria" Shield (Liquid Vaporizer)
You can't code if you are slapping mosquitoes every 30 seconds.
* **Why:** It's safer than burning coils (which choke you) and cheaper than creams.
* **Buy Here:** [Good Knight Gold Flash Machine] (PASTE_AMAZON_LINK_HERE)

### 4. A Real, Loud Alarm Clock
"I'll just use my phone." No, you won't. You'll scroll Instagram until 3 AM and snooze the alarm.
* **The Fix:** A dedicated digital clock with a loud beep. Put it on the other side of the room so you *have* to get up to turn it off.
* **My Pick:** [Digital Smart Alarm Clock] (PASTE_AMAZON_LINK_HERE)
