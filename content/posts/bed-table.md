Hostel chairs are uncomfortable. The library is too far. Sometimes, you just need to code (or watch Netflix) from your bed.

I tested the top 3 foldable tables available online. Here is the winner.

### The "Smart" Multipurpose Table
This isn't just a plank of wood. It's a workspace.
* **Feature 1:** Built-in Cup Holder (Coffee is fuel).
* **Feature 2:** Tablet/Phone Slot (Perfect for second-screen setups).
* **Feature 3:** Anti-Slip Legs (It won't wobble on your mattress).

**My Pick:** [White/Black Foldable Laptop Table] (PASTE_YOUR_AMAZON_LINK_HERE)

**Why buy it?**
It saves your back. Coding while hunched over a laptop on your lap destroys your posture. This lifts the screen to eye level.

**Price:** Approx ₹400 - ₹600.
